Once you launch EZscirpt, you will be asked to enter a file location, this is the location of a .txt file that contains your code inside it. Once you press open file, the code that is inside the file you selected will be ran.

Syntax:

if ( Value = Value );
window.size = sizeX, sizeY;
window.name = Name;
window.render = posX, posY, sizeX, sizeY
